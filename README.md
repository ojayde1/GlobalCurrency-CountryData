# Final DevOps Project
Congratulations on progressing to this stage in your DevOps journey. Now is the time to show off the stuff you're made of. 

## Instructions to complete the task 

This is your final DevOps project. Over the past 4 months, we have delved into several key DevOps tools and practices. Now is the time to use all the knowledge you have gained to achieve this end-to-end devops task. 


## Overview of the project

You have been given a nodejs application that accpets a user input and displays the country data. 

Clone the repository, and test the application locally to be sure its working. 
Run this command to install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```


and then run this command to start the application 
```bash
npm start
```

You can view the application running on loacalhost:3000 

## Your Task 

 - Write the Dockerfile to containerize the application. Build the docker image, push the image to your dockerhub registry
 - Run the container and confirm it working perfectly. 
 - Write the terraform configuration files to deploy the Application to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
 - Automate the entire deployment using Github Actions 

 ## Deliverables 
  - Take screenshots of every step, and include it in your README.md.
  - When you're done with the project, destroy your entire infrastructure using the terraform destroy command.

  ## Goodluck and all the best!
